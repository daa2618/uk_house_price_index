    Represents a file version that writes data to a file.

    Args:
        data_to_write: The data to be written to the file.  The type of this data depends on 
                     the implementation of the underlying file writing mechanism. (e.g., string, bytes, list)
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments passed to the `FileVersion` constructor.  This allows for 
                  reusing existing file versioning logic.  Example kwargs might include file path, 
                  version number, etc.

        Writes data to a file on disk.

        This method checks if the designated folder exists, optionally checks a version, 
        creates a filename, and writes the data to a file with the appropriate extension (.json or .csv).
        It handles potential errors like file already existing and data type mismatches.

        Args:
            check_version (bool): If True, performs a version check before writing the file.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If the data to be written is not compatible with the specified file extension (json or csv).  Provides a descriptive error message indicating the data type and the expected type.

            None. Prints a confirmation message upon successful file writing.
